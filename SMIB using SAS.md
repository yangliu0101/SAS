# Deriving Semi-Analytical Solutions with the Differential Transformation Method (DTM)

## Introduction
The Differential Transformation Method (DTM) is a mathematical technique used to obtain approximate solutions to differential equations. It can be particularly useful for solving ordinary differential equations in engineering and science. In this example, we will demonstrate how to use DTM to derive semi-analytical solutions for a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) system, a simplified model often used in power system analysis.

## Problem Statement
Consider a SMIB system described by the following differential equation:
$$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = P_m - P_e$$
Where:
- $\theta$ is the rotor angle in radians.
- $t$ is time in seconds.
- $P_m$ is the mechanical power input to the machine.
- $P_e$ is the electrical power output from the machine.

We want to find an approximate solution for $\theta(t)$.

## Steps to Derive Semi-Analytical Solutions using DTM

### Step 1: Define the Initial Conditions
Before applying DTM, ensure you have the initial conditions for the problem. These conditions specify the values of $\theta$ and $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ at a particular time, usually $t=0$.

### Step 2: Choose a Set of Basis Functions
In DTM, we express the solution as a series of basis functions. The choice of basis functions depends on the problem. For this example, let's choose the power series as our basis functions:
$$\theta(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n$$

### Step 3: Apply the Differential Transformation
- Calculate $\frac{d\theta}{dt}$ and $\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$ using the basis function expression and substitute them into the differential equation:
  $$\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n n(n-1) t^{n-2}$$
- Equate the right-hand side of the differential equation to $P_m - P_e$.
- This results in a recurrence relation for the coefficients $a_n$.

### Step 4: Solve for Coefficients
- Solve the recurrence relation to find the coefficients $a_n$. This may involve solving a sequence of linear algebraic equations.
- Start with the initial conditions from Step 1 and use them to determine the values of $a_n$.

### Step 5: Construct the Solution
- Once you have the coefficients $a_n$, construct the solution $\theta(t)$ using the basis function expression:
  $$\theta(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n t^n$$

## Conclusion
You have now successfully derived a semi-analytical solution for the SMIB system using the Differential Transformation Method (DTM). This approach provides an approximation to the solution and can be a valuable tool for solving differential equations in various fields of science and engineering.

Feel free to adapt these steps and techniques to other differential equation problems in your research or applications.
